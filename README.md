# Automated-Trading-System-Python

The term project is to use Python to build a trading system that maximises relative wealth
against the MSCI World benchmark during its deployment period, subject to the constraint that
its expected shortfall (ES) in the 1% tail is less than 1% of its value. After you submit the
project, I will deploy your algorithm on my machine, run it, and assess its performance at the
end of an hour.
